        <p class="text-muted">the church was surrounded by trees, which gave it a calming and peaceful sensation, the building was long with a triangular shaped form, with burgundy bricks surroundings and a bit of white in the front entrance and some at the very top and sides with a dark beige roofing to give the church some color, the windows seemed to be a tinted crystal glass that was designed with blues and a beige color. As I made my way into the church their was an entry room where a man and a women and what seemed to be their two children greeted me and handed me a pamphlet that described what was going to take place in that days Sunday school and mass, then I made my way to another pair of doors where I could hear the choir singing, as I opened the doors the inside of the church was a tan wood looking color all around  and had matching tan benches with burgundy red bedding to match the carpet, the thing that stood out most  to me when I walked in was the large cross that was in the very front that shined very bright as if the sun was hitting it to give the whole church light</p>

    <p>This year the Interschool Debate Competition was held at our school. There were 24 different schools participating. The competition was held for a week. Food and accommodation were arranged at our school hostel. All the participants were extraordinarily skilled.

      One could actually see the future leaders in the contestants. The decisions of the judges were final. There were no foul plays. This year our school won the first prize and much to our amazement two of the best speakers were from our school.
      
      All the participants were students with equal calibre and potential but in the end, some stood out shining brighter than the others. The topic for the final competition was ” the increasing number of old age homes in India “. There were so many notable points presented by each team but the point presented by the winning team was the game-changer.
      
      The prizes were given away by the honourable education minister, who talked about a few memories from his school days.</p>

    <p>A football match is quite exciting to watch. It is even more exciting to play in one. Recently our school organized a football match between two schools. It was great fun to watch. The football match was played in our school ground yesterday. It was between the school team and the university team. Our school team lost the match by 2 goals.

      It was a very exciting match. Both the teams played very well. The school team scored the first goal in the first half. But in the second half, the university team scored two goals and won the match. The school team played very well and fought hard till the end. They were unlucky to lose the match. The university team was a bit stronger and played better in the second half.
      
      The most amazing moments of the match were when our school team scored the first goal and when the university team scored the winning goals. It was a great match to watch. I suppose, the school team could have won the match. They played very well and were unlucky to lose. If they had scored more goals in the first half, they would have won the match.</p>

    <p>On the eve of the birthday of Vikram Sarabhai, (August 12, 2021), the Father of the Indian Space Programme, the Science and Research Forum of New Delhi organised an inter-school science exhibition. Candidates from different schools participated in this science exhibition. The Forum announced that the two best exhibits would be kept in the Hall of Exhibits where it will be displayed to the public. Models related to space satellites, different satellites of the planets, the various galaxies, the working of the Hadron Collider and many more things were on display. The members of the Science and Research Forum were impressed by the efforts of the students. The members of the committee had a tough time deciding which two best exhibits they were going to present in the Hall of Exhibits. Every one of the participants was given certificates and mementoes from the Science and Research Forum of New Delhi.</p>
